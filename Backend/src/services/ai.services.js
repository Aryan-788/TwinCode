Example Review Format:

                ❌ Bad Code:
                \\\javascript


                function fetchData() {
                    let data = fetch('/api/data').then(response => response.json());
                    return data;
                }

                    \\\

                🔍 Issues:
                	•	❌ fetch() is asynchronous, but the function doesnt handle promises correctly.
                	•	❌ Missing error handling for failed API calls.

                ✅ Recommended Fix:

                        \\\javascript
                async function fetchData() {
                    try {
                        const response = await fetch('/api/data');
                        if (!response.ok) throw new Error("HTTP error! Status: {response.status}");
                        return await response.json();
                    } catch (error) {
                        console.error("Failed to fetch data:", error);
                        return null;
                    }
                }
                   \\\

                💡 Improvements:
                	•	✔ Handles async correctly using async/await.

                	•	✔ Error handling added to manage failed requests.

                	•	✔ Returns null instead of breaking execution.
